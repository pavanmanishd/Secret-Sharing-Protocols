## Shamir's Secret Sharing

Shamir's Secret Sharing is a form of secret sharing, where a secret is divided into parts, giving each participant its own unique part, where some of the parts or all of them are needed in order to reconstruct the secret.

## Verifiable Secret Sharing

In addition to Shamir's Secret Sharing, Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a way to verify the correctness of the shares. Where the dealer can prove that the shares are correct and the participants can verify that the shares are correct.

## Schnorr's Signature

Schnorr's Signature is a digital signature produced by the Schnorr signature algorithm that was described by Claus Schnorr. It is a digital signature scheme known for its simplicity, among the first whose security is based on the intractability of certain discrete logarithm problems.

## Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures

FROST is a threshold signature scheme based on Schnorr signatures. It is a digital signature scheme known for its simplicity, among the first whose security is based on the intractability of certain discrete logarithm problems.
